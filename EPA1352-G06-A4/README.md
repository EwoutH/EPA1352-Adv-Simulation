## Introduction

For this assignment a CSV file was created for input data. 

- Traffic data: data/traffic_per_road.csv
- Road information: data/df_road_N1andN2.csv
 

## How to Use

Notebooks:

- travel_time_analysis is used to analyse the vulnerability with scenarios and average travel times. 
- count_amount_bridges_type the vulnerability is calculated by comparing the number of bridges.
- travel_time_analysis_iterations the importance and explanation of cooldown and runlength is described.
- traffic_EDA,the traffic data is converted from HTML to CSV.

The results of the sceranios for travel time delay are modelled in model.py and the CSV's are saved in the experiments folder. 

The results of the simulation experiments are documented in G06_Report_A4.
